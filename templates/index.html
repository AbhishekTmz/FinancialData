            <h3>Trade Activity</h3>
            <img src="{{ chart1 }}" alt="">
            <p>This graph shows how the trade volume (the total value of Bitcoin traded) compares to the transaction volume ratio (the number of Bitcoin transactions relative to total supply).</p>
            <ol>
                    <li>A high trade volume indicates strong market activity, showing how much Bitcoin is being traded daily.</li>
                    <li>A high transaction volume ratio suggests that more Bitcoin is being used in transactions rather than just being held.</li>
                    <li>If trade volume is high but transactions are low, people might be investing in Bitcoin rather than using it for purchases. If transactions are high, Bitcoin is being used more like a currency.</li>

            <h3>Network Security</h3>
            <img src="{{ chart2 }}" alt="">
            <p>This graph displays the total computational power securing the Bitcoin network, measured in terahashes per second (TH/s).
                <ol>
                    <li>Higher values indicate a more secure network.</li>
                    <li>Lower values indicate a less secure network due to lower profitability.</li>
                    <li>Sudden increases or drops in the hash rate can happen due to changes in Bitcoinâ€™s price or how hard it is to mine new Bitcoins.</li>
